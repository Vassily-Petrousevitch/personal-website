# personal-website
This is for my personal website, which I am writing in Go and HTML (using HTMX)

I intend for this website to become my custom homepage, where I can put up
projects, devlogs/blogs, and games as I please :)

It will also soon replace my old website, which you can currently see at vassily-petrousevitch.github.io
