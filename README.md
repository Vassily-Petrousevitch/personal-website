# personal-website
This is for my personal website, which I am writing in Go + HTMX

Ok, maybe not HTMX for now! This is a static site until I have a reason to do
otherwise.

I intend for this website to become my custom homepage, where I can put up
projects, devlogs/blogs, and games as I please :)
